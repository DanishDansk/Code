# WIP Zone  

Youâ€™ll find a mix of:  
- Finished (or semi-finished) projects
- Proof-of-concept code
- Random scripts that might someday become useful  
- "What was I thinking?!" commits

ðŸ”¹ **Focus areas**: Anything that caught my interest on Tuesday.

## Why So Messy?  
- I HATE coding
- I prioritize **learning** over perfection.  
- Some projects are just for fun.  
- If it works for my use case, I might not refactor (sorry).
