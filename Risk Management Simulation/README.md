# Risk Management Simulation  

A quantitative simulation for risk management, mostly in the context of information security.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project models risk scenarios using **quantitative methods** (probabilities, expected values) to assess impacts and mitigation strategies. While *not* focused on technical IT risks (e.g., vulnerabilities), it provides a framework for evaluating operational/financial risks through numerical analysis.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features  
- **ðŸ“Š Quantitative Approach**: Probabilities, cost-benefit analysis, and risk matrices.  
- **ðŸŽ¯ Simplicity**: Minimalist code for easy adaptation.  
- **ðŸ”’ InfoSec Context**: Assumes security-minded variables (e.g., data breaches, downtime costs).
